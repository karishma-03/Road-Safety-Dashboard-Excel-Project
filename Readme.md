# Road Safety Dashboard

Welcome to the **Road Safety Dashboard** repository! ðŸš—ðŸ“‰

## Project Overview
This repository contains a Road Safety Dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022, providing insights into road accidents and casualty metrics. Developed for a client, the dashboard supports data-driven decisions to improve road safety.

## Problem Statement
The client requested a dashboard with insights on:
- **Primary KPIs**: Total casualties, percentage by accident severity, and casualties by vehicle type.
- **Secondary KPIs**: Casualties by road type, surface, and location (day/night).
- Monthly trend comparison for 2021 and 2022.
